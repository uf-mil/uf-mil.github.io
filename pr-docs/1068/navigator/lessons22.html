<h1>Lessons from RobotX 2022<a class="headerlink" href="#lessons-from-robotx-2022" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p><img alt="Team Photo" src="../_images/robotx2022_team_photo.jpg" /></p>
<p>Throughout the entire process leading up to and during RobotX 2022, Team
NaviGator had fun, was able to accomplish a lot, and met a lot of great new
friends. The learned a lot along the way and wanted to record these points for
future teams to learn from!</p>
<section id="overall-improvements">
<h2>Overall Improvements<a class="headerlink" href="#overall-improvements" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Each and every system should be <em>finished</em> at least one month before the
competition.</strong> - At RobotX 2022, our kill system was not completed before the
team left for the competition in Australia. Unfortunately, this prevented the
team from being able to run NaviGator in the water, as a kill system is
required for the competition. At least one leader should ensure that every
system is completed at least one month before the competition. This does not
necessarily require the system to be <em>perfect</em>, only ready to go.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mechanical, electrical, and software should meet throughout the design
process.</strong> - While each team got together at the start of the semester to
discuss the design plan for NaviGator, this meeting was not enough to sustain
good progress throughout the semester. Each of the teams sometimes became
confused about what the other teams needed, and overall, the teams lost sync
with each other. By having regular meetings, teams can make sure that they
are working towards the same goal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We should have more design reviews from mentors.</strong> - Mentors are an important
part of the design process. Mentors can catch design flaws in systems quicker
than students can, and can show students how to improve their designs. These
design reviews do not need to be super frequent, but could maybe occur when a
new system is being designed.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="shipping-improvements">
<h2>Shipping Improvements<a class="headerlink" href="#shipping-improvements" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>We should bring more materials over air rather than shipping them.</strong> - If
cost allows, we should aim to bring more materials ourselves by plane rather
than shipping. Shipping can be a hastle and is subject to more delays than
bringing carry-ons or checking luggage. Furthermore, bringing less by
shipping can shorten our shipping manifest, making the entire shipping
process easier. One note about checking equipment is that it is likely to get
tossed around a significant amount during travel. Therefore, we will need to
pack materials cautiously, with the idea that the materials will be damaged
during shipping.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Materials should be packed with failure in mind.</strong> - At RobotX 2022, we
found out that one of our critical sensors, our LIDAR, broke. During
shipping, it had only been packed in a layer of bubble wrap and placed into a
Pelican case. This type of shipment is likely not safe for the LIDAR;
instead, it should have been placed in a custom shipping case. By asking
ourselves, “How could this item get destroyed in shipping?”, we could
possibly prevent some breakage from occurring.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Packing/parts lists need to be made for each Pelican case taken.</strong> - No
packing lists were made for any of the Pelicans shipped to the competition
site. This presented a challenge, as we weren’t sure what was in each Pelican
case, and whether we had brought all that we needed to bring. Before we left
for the competition (after the Pelicans had shipped), we wondered, “Did we
bring <a class="reference internal" href="../infrastructure/network_box.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">network box</span></a>?”, but because no
packing lists were available, we had no idea.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="mechanical-improvements">
<h2>Mechanical Improvements<a class="headerlink" href="#mechanical-improvements" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Use an organizer for tools.</strong> - Having cases/methods for keeping tools
organized helps keep everyone’s sanity at bay, and makes finding tools quick.
It is quicker to tell when tools have gone missing (as each tool now has a
dedicated spot in the organizer), and which tool is missing. Furthermore, it
becomes easier for software members, electrical members, and mentors to find
tools, even if they maybe are not acquianted with a deep knowledge of the
mechanical team.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Focus on bringing less and staying more organized.</strong> - At RobotX 2022, we
were one of the teams who had brought the most equipment, yet we had a hard
time finding much of it. Building off of the point above, we should aim to be
more organized with what we bring, so that we are able to bring less. When
tools are compactly organized into a container and each tool has a distinct
purpose for the robot, there is less of a need to bring several sets of
miscellaneous tools. Instead, we focus on bringing what we surely need to ace
the competition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We should have a fully updated CAD model.</strong> - Having a fully updated CAD
model can help us identify the position of each distinct part of NaviGator.
This is helpful for assembly, identifying what tools are needed for the
competition, and packing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consider buying individual toolboxes for mechanical leaders.</strong> - Mechanical
leaders often have to complete many quick tasks when assembling,
disassembling, and fixing NaviGator. It would help the leaders complete their
tasks quicker if they were able to have a set of tools ready on hand. With
this toolset, they would not need to share tools as often or return to the
pelicans/organizers to refill/return their tools. However, it was stressed
that if this is implemented, the tools should be of high quality.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="electrical-improvements">
<h2>Electrical Improvements<a class="headerlink" href="#electrical-improvements" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Team members should be more readily taught the electrical systems behind
NaviGator.</strong> - One issue for new electrical members is that they do not learn
about the electrical system currently implemented on NaviGator. While
electrical tutorials cover the basics of Altium and designing a circuit and
PCB, the tutorials do not cover the electrical system in place on NaviGator.
This can be a barrier to having new electrical members contribute to the
electrical system on NaviGator.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The onboarding process should be improved.</strong> - Currently, the onboarding
process is alright, but it could be improved. Currently, it’s lengthy,
written in PDFs stored in a random GitHub repository, and it contains outdated
information. Rather, this could be updated to be more interactive or helpful
to the reader (by way of YouTube videos, websites, or more streamlined PDFs).
Furthermore, many electrical members drop out of MIL during the electrical
onboarding process, suggesting that they may be frustrated with how the
process is currently done.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="software-improvements">
<h2>Software Improvements<a class="headerlink" href="#software-improvements" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>The goal should be to branch off of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">master</span></code> as soon as possible.</strong> - When
preparing for RobotX 2022, we had several branches for testing new features.
Some of the branches had branched off of other branches, which branched off
of other branches, etc. By the end, many of the branches had diverged
significantly from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">master</span></code> and other members could not find which branch was
actually being used. By encouraging a quick merge back into <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">master</span></code>, we can
ship features more quickly, make development more transparent and accessible,
and reduce the number of random branches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>More redundancy and quality should be added into solutions.</strong> - While the
software team was able to complete many of the high-level missions, these
missions often took shortcuts or skimped on quality. No integration tests
were added for many of the missions, and very few of them had their approach
documented for other members to review. We should ask ourselves, “How might
this implementation become broken?”, and then continually improve our code
from there.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We need to understand how older packages function.</strong> - Many of core
NaviGator’s libraries and systems could not be understand by any of the
software members who attended RobotX 2022. This presents a challenge, because
as soon as these implementations break, no one knows what could be wrong
without a lengthy debugging session. Rather, we nede to be able to intensely
understand the math, logic, and code behind what core packages implement.</p></li>
